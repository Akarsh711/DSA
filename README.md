# DSA
## Merge Sort
It is quite a recursivey algorith which gives you good test of recursion by having three functions,
two with same name and one with different name for merge.
```python 
 # Boiler Plate
 def mergeList(l, r):
    if l < = m :
      return 
     m = l+r//2
     mergeList(l, m)
     mergeList(m+1, r)
     merge(l, m, r)
```

The main Quesiton which personally confuse me is : how to understand recursion or recursive call?
Ans : So, the best way of understanding is by using recursive tree (along with call stack personally recommended!)
